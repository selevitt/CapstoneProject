Overview:

The idea of my capstone was to create a cash register program similar to what may be used at your local grocery store. It allows the
user to add items to a directory which stores all of their items. Each item has three aspects, name, item barcode, and price.
The user is also able to change prices by entering the item barcode and the new price. The final part of the program is the checkout. It
simulates if a customer was purchasing the items and keeps a running total of the order as they check out.

Explanation:

This capstone utilized many different skills that I learned this year. The first skill was the idea of object oriented design. I used this
to create objects that stored information required to checkout. Such as the item or the transaction. I also applied the use of a graphical
interface. I used buttons and action listeners to allow the user to input information. I also used loops to wait for a change in user input or
for searching through arrays. I implemented arrays to store items in a large directory. I had to learn more about GUI to create this program.
I had to go more in depth into different classes that help take in user data as well as constantly updating information.
